#Read Me
This project will interface with Reseller Club to manage domain names.


This is a work in progress project and something I'm using to learn Python / Django.
Expect lots of bad code and a lot of refactoring in the future :)

##Running the project
For now nothing is created other than a basic Django project. With the default settings a SQLite database will be created.
Run the following commands to get started:
* Build the database:
  * python manage.py migrate
* Run a test server:
  * python manage.py runserver
  
##Reseller Club
